# Garment Search Application using Semantic Annotation

## Project Overview

The **Garment Search Application** is a cutting-edge platform designed to assist users in finding the most suitable garments based on their body type, garment data, and user measurements. By leveraging advanced semantic annotation techniques and a custom-built model, this application provides personalized clothing recommendations. The underlying architecture is designed using **web ontology**, which allows for a structured and meaningful representation of garment attributes and user profiles.

## Features

- **Body Type Matching**: The application analyzes user body types alongside garment attributes to recommend the best-fitting clothing options.

- **User Measurements Integration**: Users can input their measurements, which are utilized to provide tailored suggestions, enhancing the overall shopping experience.

- **Semantic Annotation**: Utilizes semantic annotation to improve search capabilities, allowing users to find garments based on detailed attributes and relationships within the ontology.

- **User-Friendly UI/UX**: The interface is designed with an emphasis on intuitive navigation and an appealing aesthetic, making it easy for users to interact with the application.

- **Efficient Database Management**: The backend is developed using **Java (OOP)** principles, ensuring reliable and efficient data retrieval for garment and user information.

- **SQLite Database**: An **SQLite** database is implemented for local storage, providing a lightweight solution for managing garment and user data.

- **Web Ontology Design**: The application structure is designed using **web ontology**, which facilitates the organization of garment characteristics, body types, and user profiles in a way that enhances data interoperability and semantic reasoning.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Kotlin

- **Backend**: Java (Object-Oriented Programming)

- **Database**: SQLite

- **Web Ontology**: Used for designing the application structure to support semantic data representation and relationship management.
